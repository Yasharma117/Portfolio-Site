        Hereâ€™s the Philosophy I came up with

          Strip It Down, Then Rebuild It Emotionally
        </p>
        <p

          The original onboarding was fragmented, community onboarding in one
          place, user preferences in another. It was logically sound, but
          emotionally disjointed. My first move was to consolidate everything
          into a single, unified experience. Not just to reduce the number of
          steps, but to tell a coherent, user-centred story.
